If you think you’re pretty clued up on the Solar System, think again.
Some of these facts are absolutely out of this world!

You can't stand on Uranus
If we ever manage to travel to the gas planets, you might be in for a bit of a shock when you step off the spaceship. That’s
because Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune don’t have solid surfaces - they have a rocky core, but are mainly big balls of
hydrogen and helium.

Saturn's rings are 90% water
Saturn is home to the Solar System’s most epic ice rink. Being so far from the Sun, the water in its rings is frozen into ice. It
is one of four planets that have rings around them - the other gas planets do too. However, the rest were undiscovered until the
1970s when probes went to explore them. Saturn’s were the first rings seen through telescopes from Earth.
